# Search Employees - Practical React Project

## Overview
Search Employees is a Simple Practical React Project. This App will enables users to search and view non-sensitive data about other employees, The user simply inputs an employee name and then all employees will be filtered out and only the one who needed will remains. This Project was really fun to built and the goal of it is to practice class-based components, work with props and passing data through multiple components.
